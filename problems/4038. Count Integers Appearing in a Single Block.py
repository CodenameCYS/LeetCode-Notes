=== 4038. Count Integers Appearing in a Single Block ===

You are given an integer array nums.
An integer x is special if all occurrences of x in nums appear in a single contiguous block.
Return the number of distinct special integers in nums.

Example 1:
    Input: nums = [1,2,2,1]
    Output: 1
    Explanation:
    1 appears at indices 0 and 3, forming two separate blocks, so it is not special.
    2 appears in a single contiguous block at indices [1, 2], so it is special.
    Therefore, there is one special integer.
Example 2:
    Input: nums = [3,3,1,2,2,1]
    Output: 2
    Explanation:
    3 appears in a single contiguous block at indices [0, 1], so it is special.
    1 appears at indices 2 and 5, forming two separate blocks, so it is not special.
    2 appears in a single contiguous block at indices [3, 4], so it is special.
    Therefore, there are two special integers.

Constraints:
    1. 1 <= nums.length <= 100
    2. 1 <= nums[i] <= 100
