'''
=== 4012. Count of Unfinished Tasks After Each Shift ===

You are given two integer arrays tasks and shifts.
    - tasks[i] represents the time required to complete the ith task.
    - shifts[j] represents the amount of time available during the jth shift.
The tasks must be processed in order from left to right.
    - Carry-over: If a task is not completed during a shift, processing continues from the same point in that task during the next shift.
    - Restart: If all tasks are completed during a shift, the shift ends immediately. Any unused time in that shift is discarded, and the next shift begins again from task 0.
A task is unfinished if it has not been fully completed. This includes a task that is currently in progress.
Return an integer array ans where ans[j] is the number of unfinished tasks immediately after the jth shift.

Example 1:
    Input: tasks = [1,4,4], shifts = [9,1,4]
    Output: [0,2,1]
    Explanation:
    Shift 0: The tasks require 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 units of time, so all tasks are completed. There are 0 unfinished tasks.
    Shift 1: Processing restarts from task 0. The shift has time 1, so task 0 is completed. There are 2 unfinished tasks.
    Shift 2: Processing continues from task 1. The shift has time 4, so task 1 is completed. There is 1 unfinished task.
Example 2:
    Input: tasks = [2,3,4], shifts = [20,4,5]
    Output: [0,2,0]
    Explanation:
    Shift 0: The tasks require 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 units of time, so all tasks are completed. The remaining time in this shift is ignored. There are 0 unfinished tasks.
    Shift 1: Processing restarts from task 0. The shift has time 4, so task 0 is completed and task 1 is partially completed. There are 2 unfinished tasks.
    Shift 2: Processing continues from task 1. The remaining time needed is 1 + 4 = 5, so all tasks are completed. There are 0 unfinished tasks.
Example 3:
    Input: tasks = [4,2], shifts = [3,6,1]
    Output: [2,0,2]
    Explanation:
    Shift 0: The shift has time 3, so task 0 is partially completed with 1 unit of work remaining. There are 2 unfinished tasks.
    Shift 1: Processing continues from task 0. The remaining time needed is 1 + 2 = 3, so all tasks are completed. There are 0 unfinished tasks.
    Shift 2: Processing restarts from task 0. The shift has time 1, so task 0 is partially completed. There are 2 unfinished tasks.
 
Constraints:
    1. 1 <= tasks.length <= 105
    2. 1 <= shifts.length <= 105
    3. 1 <= tasks[i] <= 109
    4. 1 <= shifts[i] <= 109
