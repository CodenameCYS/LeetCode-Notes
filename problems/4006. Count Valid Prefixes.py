=== 4006. Count Valid Prefixes ===

You are given a binary string s.
A prefix of s is considered valid if its characters can be rearranged to form an alternating string.
Return the number of valid prefixes of s.
A string is considered alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal.

Example 1:
    Input: s = "00101"
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    The valid prefixes are:
    "0": It is already an alternating string.
    "001": It can be rearranged into "010", which is an alternating string.
    "00101": It can be rearranged into "01010", which is an alternating string.
    Thus, the answer is 3.
Example 2:
    Input: s = "101"
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    All prefixes of s = "101" are already alternating strings. Thus, the answer is 3.

Constraints:
    1. 1 <= s.length <= 100
    2. s consists only of '0' and '1'.
